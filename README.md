This project predicts motor score changes in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease patients using LFP signals pre- and post-DBS. Features like beta power difference were extracted to train models including Random Forest and XGBoost, achieving over 92% accuracy. Data and model scripts, along with analysis, are included.
